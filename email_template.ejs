      How's it goin? Hope all is well! It's been around <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm currently learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and wanted to include you in a project I'm working on.

      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
